Nail has been exquisitely remixed by progressive trance legend Rich Soloarstone who keeps the song structure in place, and melodies to the fore, but adds precision engineered rhythms and swelling builds for maximum summer dancefloor impact.\n",

            "Here’s what the pre-release press has had to say :\n",
            "“Following on from their critically-acclaimed 2018 release Light Of The Fearless – an album eight years in the making which saw them execute a precision comeback with a sold out tour – Black Halo reaches for those sweet spots between the contrasts once again. Somewhere deep between organic and electronic, faith and escapism, strings and synths, drums and bass, fear and hope, it’s a place where Hybrid can tell their boldest stories so far.\n",
            "Merging Jimi Hendrix-styled guitar riffs via guitarist/vocalist Stu Morgan into Mike's sonic soundscapes and punctuated by drummer Simon Hanson’s meticulous rhythms, Hybrid’s music allows Charlotte’s clear and pristine vocals to float and weave effortlessly. Black Halo focuses in on microcosms of these sounds from the brooding stormy weather of tracks like \"Lost Angeles\" and \"Seven Days\" to the ghostly melodic pop of \"No One Knows\" and \"Nails\" to the icy glittering rhythm of \"Come Back To Me\" and to the anxiety and drive of tracks like \"Flashpoint\" and \"Voices In The Static.\"\n",

            "This is a little later today because I am running on about three hours of sleep - Baby K has been sick for a few days, and is a bit better now, but because of that, her sleep schedule is all out of whack, it seems, which means her parents get no sleep either. What I've been up to this week: Buying baby clothes . Baby K *really* does not need any more clothing—between what I bought her previously, plus a ton of hand-me-downs, she's set until at least she fits into 12 months size—but everything is so cute. I also get a little sad when she sizes out of onesies I really liked, but Carter's usually has patterns up to size 12M, sometimes even 24M, so I can repurchase them. There was one I really wanted and they only had up to size 6M online, but I was able to order it in the store ... so I visited the Farmington Hills location for the first time ever, and of course ended up buying MORE cute onesies, like the one pictured above. Some in the baby boy section are also super cute, li...\n",

She's only 12 weeks old, so that's too young to go out, but we got a grand total of *three* trick-or-treaters this year, and she greeted them at the door with us. It did give us an excuse to dress her up in cute outfits, though, including the pumpkin hat you see above (which is SUPER cute but always falls off of her, LOL). Hoping next year will be more eventful.  Running errands . On Friday, I took Baby K to get an RSV shot ...

I hadn't seen this one yet, and although the music isn't super remarkable, it's definitely worth seeing for the special effects/tech itself.

Life seems easy for picture-perfect couple Ivy (Colman) and Theo (Cumberbatch): successful careers, a loving marriage, great kids. But beneath the façade of their supposed ideal life, a storm is brewing – as Theo’s career nosedives while Ivy’s own ambitions take off, a tinderbox of fierce competition and hidden resentment ignites.

A friend I know from a Meetup group for board games, whom I've probably known for about 5-10 years now, got married on Saturday night at the Henry Ford (Lovett Hall, technically) and my husband and I attended it. The venue was beautiful, and it's very historical, too; there was a board up on the wall with some old clippings, news items, etc. about the venue. We didn't stay too long, only until about 10pm, but it was still nice to get all dressed up and also see my friend get married—I believe the last time we saw each other IRL was when my husband and I visited Boston in 2023, and took engagement photos, since she now lives in Boston.

            "This week has been very busy with friend visits—Baby K got to meet two of my friends, and four of my husband's friends (two couples), which was a lot of fun.  What I've been up to this week: Meet and greets with Baby K . Last Friday, some friends of my husband came over and brought homemade carrot cake and garden tomatoes, which was very nice. On Sunday, more friends came over, one of whom was the Best Man in our wedding, and brought us some flowers and Blake's ciders. On Wednesday, one of my friends visited (actually, one of the bridesmaids from our wedding), and brought some Thai food from Ann Arbor/Ypsi—Basil Babe, so good—and some sleep sacks for Baby K. And on Thursday, another of my friends visited, and brought some Eagle Rare (made by Buffalo Trace) from her Louisville visit, for my husband and I, plus a lot of cute gifts for Baby K. In addition, this weekend my in-laws will be visiting, since my husband and I are attending a wedding tomorrow at the Henry Ford and ne...\n",

            "Honoured Peoples, thank you for joining us in Dublin, Ireland. It was wonderful to welcome you all - our guests, participants, volunteers and so many of you for the first time to a Worldcon.\n",
            "I know now that many of you now know, that a Worldcon in one’s country is an amazing thing, a fabulous gathering and an incredibly hard task - worth the efforts, toil, blood, sweat and tears. It was wonderful to see so many people join us. It was a great time. We brought the world to Ireland and we celebrated the best, brightest and brilliance of Ireland with you all. I have so many people to thank, but fortunately, some of that task was completed in our souvenir book and at our closing and any time I spoke, but should you have been busy and missed this - please accept my thanks.\n",
            "I cannot believe that so suddenly the first Irish Worldcon is over, as I stood in an empty warehouse, and quiet convention centre. I can only hope that you have good memories, have formed good friendships and enjoyed the convention. I look forward to seeing many of you again both afar, but I hope on these shores once more.\n",

            "Are you looking for one of the best beer festivals in the country?  Look in Denver on March 16th from 3-6pm at the downtown Hyatt Regency. Collaboration Fest will be back for its sixth year pouring 100 beers brewed from collaborations between 200 breweries.\n",
            "Cheers to Collaboration Fest - the can't miss beer festival of the year   photo by Jerome Shaw\n",
            "Collaboration Fest is an intimate craft beer experience much more approachable than larger beer festivals like the Great American Beer Festival (GABF) or even Big Beers, Belgians and Barleywines Festival (BBBBF.) But just like BBBBF there are some incredible big chewy beers for you to sample.  If you love Imperial Stouts, Double IPAs and beers that run over 10%ABV you’ll love Collaboration Fest.  The tickets https://www.collaborationfest.com/2019-ticketing are priced at $65 for the Collaborator Ticket and $85 for the Connoisseur Ticket (early access at 2 PM)\n",
            "Collaboration Fest at the Downtown Denver Hyatt Regency  photo by Jerome Shaw\n",
            "This festival is a chance to expanse your style-education and pushes the boundaries of what you regularly drink.  You’ll find beers that defy classification and beers that expand the definition of beer.  There are also beers that bring together two breweries and two beer styles along with what seem to be familiar beers but they often have a bit of a twist.\n",

            "Legislation prohibiting the teaching of sexual identity or gender orientation is on its way to the Governor after a nearly three hour debate this morning in the Florida Senate. As Mike Vasilinda tells us, Equality Florida says lawsuits alleging discrimination will be filed if the bill isn’t vetoed by the Governor.\n",
            "Nicknamed the Don’t Say Gay bill by opponents, the legislation prohibits a teacher led curriculum that deals with sexual identity and gender orientation for kids in the third grade or younger. Supporter Danny Burgess (R-Tampa) says its that simple.\n",
            "“This bill says, Parents, your right to raise your children does not end when they walk into a classroom.”\n",
            "But Democrat Tina Polsky argued the bill is about satisfying a political base and purposefully discriminating.\n",
            "“Its because it sends a message; that they don’t matter. They need to be hidden. That it shouldn’t be talked about, and that there should be shame” Polsky told her colleagues.\n",
            "Democratic Leader Lauren Book cautioned the states teacher shortage will only get worse.\n",
            "“They’re not secretly pushing the gay agenda, the trans agenda, the woke agenda. It’s it’s not happening” said Book in debate.\n",
            "But in the end, supporters say its about parents deciding what’s best for their kids.\n",
            "“We have to let kids be kids” said Sen. Manny Diaz (R-Miami) “And in a kindergarten through third grade instruction, there are topics that our kids are not mature enough to understand or grasp.”\n",
            "Two republicans joined Democrats in voting no. “22 yeas, 17 nays Mr. President.”\n",
            "And if the Governor doesn’t veto this legislation, the next step we are told is legal action.\n",
            "How quickly a suit will be filed depends on how and when the Governor acts.\n",

            "The Governor has already indicated he will sign the bill. His spokesperson has been under fire for tweeting that the legislation would be better called the anti grooming bill, which angered opponents who say they were being called pedophiles.\n",

            "March 7th, 2022 by Mike Vasilinda\n",
            "The Florida Senate will spent time later this afternoon going through amendments and asking questions about the so called Don’t Say Gay” bill. It is now teed up for a final vote tomorrow. As Mike Vasilinda tells us, the bill could be on the Governor’s desk as early as tomorrow over the objections of protestors who were in the Capitol.\n",
            "Just over a hundred protestors streamed into the Capitol to hold a sit in as the Senate was ready to take up House Bill 1557, Its official title is Parents Rights in Education. Opponents have dubbed it the Don’t Say Gay Bill.\n",
            "Gay, gay, my daughters gay” sang a group of female Senators  who marched up and down the Capitol’s fourth floor rotunda.\n",
            "StateRep. Anna Eskamani called on the crow to hold the Governor’s Press Secretary accountable for tweeting the bill should be called the anti grooming bill.\n",
            "“She’s telling us that we are groomers for supporting this bill” said Eskamani. “This bill is dangerous to every child in Florida.”\n",
            "The Governor and Sponsor were also the butt of a Saturday Night Live skit over the weekend.\n",
            "Kate McKinnon delivered this line after sounding confused about what the bill does ”It just feels like this is going to make kids gay and trans. Sorry. Gay and suicidal.”\n",
            "Sponsor Dennis Baxley said he hopes to redirect attention from the Dont say gay moniker to what he says the bill does…put parents in charge.\n",
            "“What we are prohibiting is instructing them in a specific direction versus students can talk about what ever they want to bring up. But sometimes the right answer is that you really ought to talk to your parents about that” says Baxley.\n",
            "The Senator does tell us he’s surprised by the attention the bill is getting. He calls its mission simple.\n",
            "“Flordia will be a better place because more and more parents are embracing their responsibility” says the sponsor.\n",
            "And the Governor’s left no doubt, he’ll sign this legislation.\n",

            "March 4th, 2022 by Mike Vasilinda\n",
            "The University of Florida is beginning its search for a new President this month, and as Mike Vasilinda tells us, legislation sent to the Governor today could make it the first such search held behind closed doors since the late 1960’s.\n",
            "The formal investiture of FSU President Richard McCullough was February 25th. He came from Harvard and may be the last university in President to have gone through the open process.\n",
            "The vote: “86 yeas, 26 nays” announced the reading clerk.\n",
            "Friday, lawmakers sent legislation to the Governor taking university searches out of the public eye until finalists have been selected. At that point, there will be a 21 day public vetting before a selection can be made. Lawmakers from both parties say the sunshine isn’t working. Rep. Stan McClain (R-Ocala) learned about the diffuculty of public searches as a county commissioner.\n",
            "“It absolutely has a chilling effect on the applicants that might apply” McClain told the Hose.\n",
            "Rep. Ramon Alexander (D-Tallahassee) is one of two members to have served on a search committee. “This is about expanding the applicant pool. If anybody is about diversity its me. Hello.”\n",
            "But opponents argued it the openness isn’t killing the applicant pool. Rep. Joe Geller\n",
            "(D-Broward) says only the weak would be intimidated by the sunshine.\n",
            "“It does nothing but keep out the feint of heart” says Geller. “It does nothing but keep out the people who don’t have confidence they are going to make it to the final.”\n",
            "For the last decade this legislation has gotten more yes than no votes every time the legislature has voted. But its never gotten the two thirds required, until today, until today, to take something out of the public eye.\n",
            "Rep. Sam Garrison sponsored the House bill.\n",
            "“Its encouraging to see bills come back through time and gain momentum as it goes along” garrison told us. “I think it speaks to good policy” he says.\n",

            "March 4th, 2022 by Mike Vasilinda\n",
            "The Florida Legislature today sent two new congressional maps to the Governor, a primary map, and a backup incase the courts throw the first map out. But it may be for naught. During the debate in the House, Governor Ron DeSantis tweeted he would veto the maps. Democrat Leader Evan Jenne said its time for lawmakers to start over.\n",
            "“I just wanted to read you a tweet” began Jenne. “I will veto the congressional apportionment plan currently being debated by the House. Period. DOA Period. That tweet came from out own Governor just moments ago. So as we do this is a product that is already been claimed as dead on arrival when it hits the Governor’s desk. Members, we need to seriously consider what we are doing with this bill.”\n",
            "But the House passed the map legislation anyway. A short time later, the Senate approved the maps and send the bill to the Governor. Lawmakers could override the anticipated veto, but that seems unlikely for the GOP controlled legislature.\n",

            "While trying to connect with our friends afar via social media, many of us forget to talk with those who are close to us: Our families.\n",
            "BOCCO emo is designed to help loved ones stay in touch and talk more to create even tighter family bonds.\n",
            "FEATURES\n",
            "Exchanging Messages\n",
            "BOCCO emo makes sending and receiving messages as easy as 1, 2, 3 — even for your grandparents!\n",
            "You can easily type or record your message on BOCCO emo’s mobile app. Just press \"send,\" and the robot that your family has at home will start playing it for them. Your family can simply press the \"record\" and \"send\" buttons on the robot to reply to your message. The app on your phone will automatically transcribe those replies into a text format.\n",
            "To replay a message on the robot, you can say, \"emo-chan, play my messages.\" for example. You can also give a unique name to BOCCO emo instead of the default name, \"emo-chan.\"\n",
            "Weather Alert and Schedule Reminders\n",
            "BOCCO can send you weather alerts and schedule reminders. These are some of BOCCO emo’s “IoT functions.” You also can connect BOCCO emo to various “smart” devices to operate them remotely and receive notifications via the robot.\n",
            "Sensor Connection\n",
            "By linking up with various sensors, you can receive notifications when a family member returns home, or measure the temperature and humidity of certain rooms when you are not home.\n",
            "BOCCO emo has three types of built-in sensors. Using an illuminance sensor, a vibration sensor, and a motion sensor, it accurately grasps the surrounding conditions and returns the best response.\n",
            "Reacts to Your Words\n",
            "BOCCO emo can respond to your greetings such as \"I'm home!\" or even phrases like \"I'm tired.\"\n",
            "It can interact with family members using its original \"emo language.\" You will be able to understand it naturally through its emotional expressions.\n",
            "By spending time with you and your family, BOCCO emo grows and evolves to become a more connected robot. BOCCO emo will continue to grow with updates even after it arrives at your home.\n",
            "APPLICATION\n",
            "The BOCCO emo app is a family bulletin board that allows you to check on your family and sensor responses. When you talk to BOCCO emo, your voice is sent as a voice message. You can also send a text or voice message through your smartphone.\n",
            "Family members will be able to communicate easily with children, parents, and grandparents who cannot operate smartphones.\n",

Rémy Cazals, spécialiste de Jean Jaurès, l’une des figures politiques les plus illustres de son temps, en révèle une facette inconnue, un Jaurès détective. Et Rémy Cazals d’ajouter une pierre nouvelle concourant à démontrer l’intelligence universelle de l’Homme et son zèle à lutter contre l’une des plus grandes injustices du XIXe siècle. Un opuscule aussi éclairant qu’opportun et une pièce maîtresse ajoutée à une affaire Dreyfus remise en permanence dans l’espace contemporain. »\n",
            "2 juillet – 29 septembre 1898, une correspondance révélatrice comme éclairante\n",
            "Le 12 juillet 2025 est déclaré officiellement jour de commémoration de la réhabilitation du capitaine Alfred Dreyfus par le président de la République française. L’affaire Dreyfus est certainement l’événement le plus marquant et le plus traumatique de la Troisième République, divisant en deux la nation française dans une dualité politique loin des simples courants de pensée en vogue au sein de la société de l’époque. En effet, en 1898, l’opinion est égarée par le silence des autorités, civiles comme militaires, par les affirmations haineuses péremptoires et l’abondance des récits fantaisistes, y compris par la présentation de documents officiels émanant des plus hautes autorités ministérielles. Jean Jaurès, ulcéré devant l’injustice, se lance alors dans une enquête systématique qui prouve l’innocence de Dreyfus, la culpabilité d’Estherazy et la fabrication de faux documents. Cette enquête est révélée dans une correspondance d’été, intégralement publiée dans cet opuscule.\n",
            "Rémy Cazals démontre ici une facette parfaitement méconnue de l’illustre, assurément le plus grand tribun de l’Histoire politique française. Il dévoile ainsi la méthode rigoureuse d’un Jaurès détective, qui aurait pu inspirer celle d’Hercule Poirot. Une double enquête haletante, de coup de théâtre en coup de rasoir ; celle de Jean Jaurès et celle de Rémy Cazals qui remet en lumière l’Affaire Dreyfus d’une manière parfaitement originale.\n",

            "Alexandre Lafon, Joffre\n",
            "De son vivant, Joseph Joffre (1852-1931) – l’un des huit grands maréchaux français de la Première Guerre mondiale – a fait l’objet d’un véritable culte mémoriel et populaire comme en témoignent les noms de rues de nos villes et sa statue dominant l’entrée de l’École militaire sur le Champ-de-Mars à Paris. Bustes en plâtres, assiettes et autres cartes postales patriotiques racontent aussi la puissance d’une légende entrée dans les foyers dès la guerre.\n",
            "Le prestige du « père Joffre » reste surtout associé à la victoire de la Marne de septembre 1914, ce redressement spectaculaire des armées franco-britanniques à la suite d’un été meurtrier, érigé en événement majeur de la « Grande Guerre » et de l’histoire nationale. Depuis lors, aucune controverse sérieuse n’a réussi à « déboulonner » la stature du personnage.\n",
            "Qui est donc, derrière le mythe du vainqueur, ce polytechnicien de Rivesaltes entré très tôt dans le génie militaire ? Officier à la carrière remarquable en République et dans ses colonies, il a été généralissime dans une période décisive. Conscient de ses prérogatives, il a tenté de conserver la main sur les opérations militaires face à un pouvoir civil d’abord consentant, puis méfiant et agacé, qui le remercie en décembre 1916 avec le titre de maréchal de France.\n",
            "L’auteur propose ici d’interroger la vie de Joseph Joffre, sa mémoire mythifiée et les formes qu’elle a pu prendre, jusqu’à son éclipse quasi-totale à l’orée des commémorations du centenaire de la Première Guerre mondiale. Les sources permettent de comprendre la construction d’une légende, et derrière elle, le parcours d’un chef de guerre, ni ange, ni démon, au temps du roman national d’alors, sensible à valoriser les « grands hommes ».\n",
            "Alexandre Lafon est docteur en histoire contemporaine, chercheur associé à l’Université de Toulouse 2 – Jean Jaurès, membre du CRID1418. Professeur agrégé et chargé de cours à l’Institut national universitaire Champollion d’Albi et auteur d’ouvrages sur la Première Guerre mondiale (La camaraderie au front 1914-1918, Armand Colin, 2016), il poursuit ses recherches autour de la mise en mémoire des conflits contemporains.\n",

            "Il s’agit d’abord de comprendre la décision d’écrire. Les motivations varient : les dirigeants militaires et politiques cherchent à justifier leur action ; chez les écrivains, il faut faire la part des effets littéraires ; il existe des livres de propagande et d’autres qui réagissent au bourrage de crâne ; beaucoup d’auteurs ont tenu à garder la trace d’années extraordinaires perdues pour la vraie vie.\n",
            "Il fallait ensuite suivre ces textes sur le chemin de l’édition. Avant 1930, seuls des intellectuels et des notables ont su emprunter cette voie qu’ils connaissaient bien. La publication des témoignages des “gens ordinaires” a attendu deux générations, et il faut mettre en valeur le travail des “passeurs”, membres de la famille, historiens, associations, éditeurs passionnés.\n",

            "Colonies, travailleurs coloniaux\n",
            "Voici assurément un ouvrage bienvenu, non seulement parce qu’il allie érudition et clarté, mais aussi parce qu’il comble une lacune partielle de l’historiographie de langue française. Appuyé sur des sources abondantes et variées, tirées d’archives nationales, départementales et municipales, ainsi que sur des publications d’époque et une solide bibliographie, il traite d’un sujet fondamental pour comprendre à la fois les ressorts économiques de la Grande Guerre, les fondements de la colonisation et les préjugés racistes d’une époque. Le titre, fort bien choisi, résume à merveille le propos de l’auteur : il s’agit de montrer que l’État français en guerre ne peut pas se passer d’un appoint de main-d’œuvre non européenne, mais qu’en même temps il cherche à en limiter la portée pour des raisons idéologiques et socio-politiques. Le livre est construit autour de huit grands chapitres de longueur à peu près équivalente, encadrés par une introduction et une conclusion qui assurent bien leurs fonctions respectives, à savoir éclairer le sujet et répondre aux questions qu’il pose.\n",
            "Dès les premières pages, Laurent Dornel met au cœur de sa démonstration le problème de l’assimilation en montrant que les théories racialistes de l’époque visent à promouvoir, écrit-il, « un système discursif organisé qui fonde l’indésirabilité de l’immigration coloniale ». Certes, comme l’indique le titre du premier chapitre, les colonies constituent aux yeux des autorités « un merveilleux réservoir d’hommes », soldats ou travailleurs. Mais il est hors de question pour elles de promouvoir une immigration libre ; il convient au contraire de l’encadrer pour la contrôler et l’organiser. Au demeurant, beaucoup d’administrateurs coloniaux sont réticents au départ vers la métropole car ils craignent tout autant la pénurie de travailleurs disponibles que leur perversion au contact de la métropole où ils pourraient, en côtoyant des autochtones, acquérir des idées subversives de l’ordre colonial, et, pire, séduire des Françaises.\n",
            "Les premiers contingents de travailleurs coloniaux arrivent néanmoins au printemps 1915, mais en petit nombre encore. Durant l’été, est créé le Service de l’organisation des travailleurs coloniaux, le SOTC, désormais chargé d’accueillir et de répartir les nouveaux arrivants. En février 1916, est ouvert son grand dépôt de Marseille qui peut loger 5000 hommes, le temps de les vacciner, de les classer par aptitudes et de les immatriculer avant leur départ pour le lieu de travail censé les accueillir. Pour éviter les conflits, les arrivants sont regroupés par nationalités sous la surveillance d’officiers et de sous-officiers français, chargés de maintenir une discipline paternaliste, mais ferme. Les affectations ultérieures dépendent de critères racialistes qui essentialisent les « indigènes » en leur attribuant d’office des qualités et des défauts liés à leur origine (par exemple, les Kabyles sont jugés supérieurs aux Arabes). Toutefois, le SOTC, placé sous la tutelle du ministère de la Guerre, mais travaillant avec de nombreux autres ministères (Colonies, Affaires étrangères, Intérieur, Armement, Agriculture), se retrouve au cœur de conflits internes qui en perturbent le fonctionnement, rendu déjà difficile par les moyens limités dont il dispose.\n",
            "Le troisième chapitre, intitulé « Les travailleurs coloniaux, portrait de groupe » décrit de manière précise leurs différents statuts. Les Nord-Africains ont des contrats de trois mois au minimum et bénéficient de la loi sur les accidents du travail de 1898. Ils sont considérés comme travailleurs civils et ont des salaires alignés sur ceux des ouvriers français. Les Indochinois et les Malgaches sont au contraire militarisés (sauf les interprètes), ce qui provoque sur place quelques révoltes contre le recrutement. Ils sont pris pour la durée de la guerre plus six mois. Leurs droits sont inférieurs à ceux des Nord-Africains et, par conséquent, des Français, notamment en matière de retraites. Les Chinois ne sont pas, à proprement parler, des travailleurs coloniaux, mais ils sont traités comme tels, bien qu’ils proviennent d’un État en principe souverain. Leurs contrats portent sur plusieurs années. Ils n’ont pas droit non plus à la retraite et leurs salaires sont souvent très médiocres. Logement, nourriture et habillement sont déduits de leurs émoluments. Ils ne sont pas militaires, mais sont cependant placés sous l’autorité d’un commandant de groupement. Au total, 220 000 ouvriers coloniaux sont recrutés entre 1916 et 1918, dont 150 000 environ sont présents en même temps sur le sol français à la fin de la guerre ; 60 % environ viennent d’Afrique du Nord et 40 % d’Asie ou de Madagascar. Ils travaillent en majorité pour l’industrie de l’armement, qu’elle soit publique ou privée. On les trouve donc pour l’essentiel dans les grandes régions industrielles de l’époque. L’administration prend soin de séparer le plus possible entre elles les différentes nationalités pour éviter les querelles, relativement fréquentes.\n",
            "Un des défis posés aux autorités est de discipliner et d’identifier la main-d’œuvre coloniale. C’est l’objet du chapitre 4. Comme il n’est pas possible de reproduire en métropole les règles de l’indigénat, l’administration invente de nouveaux dispositifs réglementaires pour « protéger » à la fois les travailleurs étrangers et les Français. Cette « obsession de la surveillance » est présente dans tous les domaines : travail, santé, usage d’alcool ou de drogue, circulation intérieure, fréquentations et courrier. « Les travailleurs coloniaux sont considérés comme des enfants dont il faut éclairer l’entendement », rappelle Laurent Dornel ; il faut donc établir un « système punitif spécifique » ainsi qu’une forme de militarisation sous l’égide d’officiers coloniaux, habitués aux rigueurs de l’indigénat. Les principaux instruments du contrôle administratif sont le livret de travail et le permis de séjour qui permettent d’identifier les individus et de freiner le débauchage et le vagabondage. En avril 1917, la carte d’identité devient obligatoire pour les étrangers de plus de 15 ans ; désormais, quand un travailleur arrive sur son lieu de travail, il doit la déposer chez le maire ou auprès du commissaire de police.\n",
            "Le paternalisme de l’administration, totalement assumé, repose sur l’idée de l’inégalité des races, mais aussi le respect des religions, des coutumes et des mœurs « indigènes ». L’instauration de « foyers coloniaux » est un des moyens utilisés par les autorités pour « éduquer » les travailleurs coloniaux et les préserver des mauvais comportements, tout en donnant à une partie d’entre eux une formation professionnelle et linguistique. Autre création ad hoc, les Bureaux des affaires indigènes, destinés à faciliter les relations des travailleurs concernés avec l’administration française et à les conseiller au besoin en matière d’emploi et de vie quotidienne. Lesdits BAI ont toutefois des rapports tendus avec le SOTC qui reste jaloux de ses prérogatives.\n",
            "Cet encadrement pesant n’empêche pas l’insubordination des intéressés qui prend des formes variées, traitées par le sixième chapitre. Parfois, la résistance est douce, fondée sur des tactiques d’évitement comme faire semblant de ne pas comprendre les ordres ou se dérober devant l’accomplissement de certaines tâches. La fuite hors du lieu de travail est une autre stratégie, souvent utilisée dans la zone des armées ; elle concerne au bas mot des centaines de cas. Il existe également un volant de 30 000 à 40 000 hommes qui échappe au contrôle du SOTC, parfois en se servant de faux papiers ; parmi ces travailleurs dits libres, il y a de nombreux Kabyles, déjà habitués à émigrer dans le cadre de réseaux spéciaux.\n",
            "Mais la lutte peut devenir frontale. De nombreuses grèves éclatent aux quatre coins de la France à partir de l’automne 1916 jusqu’à la fin du conflit : des villes comme Roanne, Châtellerault, Lyon, Saint-Étienne, Dunkerque, La Machine (Nièvre), Le Creusot, Bordeaux, entre autres, sont touchées par ces conflits. Le plus souvent, elles visent à protester contre de mauvaises conditions de logement ou contre le comportement inadéquat de l’encadrement.\n",
            "Laurent Dornel, s’inspirant de James Scott, évoque aussi l’existence d’une « subculture dissidente » faite de petits trafics, de libertinage, de recherche du plaisir, de trafic de papiers ou tromperies vis-à-vis des autorités de tutelle qui sont autant de réactions contre la surveillance systématique et la volonté des autorités de les voir vivre en marge de la société ambiante. La correspondance avec les familles restées au pays révèle, malgré la censure, un certain mécontentement, mais aussi, parfois, le désir de rester quelques temps après la guerre sur le sol français.\n",
            "Mais la plus grande peur de la puissance publique semble être le métissage et les unions interraciales. Le chapitre 7 donne de nombreux exemples de ce « tabou colonial » que constituent les relations intimes entre « blanches et indigènes ». De nombreuses mises en garde sont ainsi envoyées aux municipalités pour qu’elles freinent au maximum les mariages mixtes. La circulaire confidentielle Viviani du 2 février 1917 souligne les dangers que de telles unions recèlent ; elle est mise en œuvre par le SOTC qui craint la perte de prestige des blancs et les problèmes qu’elle peut poser ultérieurement dans les colonies. Tout un débat naît entre spécialistes pour savoir quel degré de radicalité doivent prendre les mesures de défense. Il révèle néanmoins un certain embarras du pouvoir face à cette question. En effet, il est globalement hostile aux relations interraciales, mais il hésite à suivre les colonialistes les plus radicaux tels que Pierre de Maroussem pour qui « Les grandes nations colonisatrices interdisent ou découragent les unions mixtes … », ne serait-ce que pour empêcher « perversion et dégénérescence des hybrides ».\n",
            "Il n’empêche que le mépris et la haine envers les femmes qui consentent à des relations avec des travailleurs coloniaux est assez général. On en vient même à les accuser après-guerre d’être « … le courrier secret entre les membres des groupes extrémistes de France, tant français qu’asiatiques », lourde allusion à la poussée de l’anticolonialisme en Asie et au Maghreb. Selon Laurent Dornel, cette « racialisation se fait par le haut » car il postule que « L’opposition aux mariages mixtes n’apparaît pas comme une exigence des populations françaises, mais bien plutôt comme une nécessité imposée par une grande partie des élites politiques, intellectuelles, scientifiques, métropolitaines et surtout coloniales ».\n",
            "Le dernier chapitre traite logiquement du retour. Les autorités françaises sont pour un départ rapide des travailleurs coloniaux après le conflit, contraintes qu’elles sont par les demandes insistantes des colons, notamment en Algérie. Mais les entorses à ce principe se multiplient, d’autant que certains employeurs français, confrontés eux aussi à une pénurie de main-d’œuvre, n’hésitent pas à réembaucher des travailleurs coloniaux. Par ailleurs, la démobilisation est chaotique car le SOTC est rapidement débordé dans son dépôt de Marseille, du fait du manque de bateaux, de la grippe espagnole et de la délinquance liée au désœuvrement et aux conditions d’hébergement dégradées.\n",
            "Un débat sur l’assouplissement de l’indigénat est engagé en 1919, mais il se heurte au puissant lobby colonial, de telle sorte qu’il est rapidement abandonné par le gouvernement. En outre, si les autorités françaises souhaitent recourir à l’immigration pour relancer l’économie, elles refusent de faire revenir en masse des travailleurs coloniaux, comme le leur déconseillent maints experts qui craignent, comme un certain L. Chassevent, de « modifier les caractères et qualités de notre race ». On décide donc de recourir à de la main-d’œuvre européenne qui peut éventuellement faire venir les familles.\n",
            "En conclusion, Laurent Dornel estime qu’il y a après-guerre « un tournant dans la racialisation de la société française ». On passe, écrit-il, « du Kabyle laborieux au sidi, du travailleur indochinois docile au militant communiste ou nationaliste insaisissable ». Se dessine alors une volonté de reprendre les choses en main. De plus, de nombreux intellectuels européens, à l’instar d’un Spengler, d’un Toynbee, d’un Valéry ou d’un Siegfried, insistent sur le refus du métissage ; certains vont même jusqu’à évoquer le développement nécessaire d’une « lutte des races ». Pourtant, l’armée française continue à prévoir en cas de conflit l’utilisation d’un fort volant de soldats et de travailleurs coloniaux, à condition de solidement les encadrer.\n",
            "Cet ouvrant passionnant mérite donc de connaître le succès car il nous fait bien comprendre les enjeux idéologiques et culturels qui se dessinent derrière l’utilisation et le contrôle de la main-d’œuvre coloniale à un moment où l’ensemble des forces du pays sont engagées dans un conflit sans merci. Sa construction minutieuse et ses analyses fouillées en feront sans doute même un classique. Tout au plus peut-on regretter certaines redites au cours de la démonstration et l’absence d’index final. Mais la perfection n’est pas de ce monde ; contentons-nous ici de l’excellence.\n",

Vincent Suard, qui participe à son élaboration, a eu l’occasion d’analyser, une quarantaine de récits septentrionaux. Partant de l’étude d’un espace précis (Leers – Lys-lez-Lannoy), il formulera des remarques liées à la vie dans cet espace frontalier, puis seront envisagés quelques aspects du récit d’occupation dans l’espace départemental, notamment le manque de nouvelles et les stratégies inventées pour arriver à correspondre, la souffrance morale liée à la séparation, des deux côtés du Front, ou l’importance de la composante religieuse dans certains carnets. Comment penser l’exil ? Existe-t-il une spécificité du poilu chtimi ? De la nordiste occupée ? Comment considérer cette source contrainte ? Quelle est la place des biais sociaux dans ces journaux ? Avec ce questionnement, Vincent Suard tentera d’évoquer, sans aucune ambition d’exhaustivité, quelques thématiques d’un témoignage nordiste décidément particulier.\n",

            "Dans l’Aisne et de l’Oise, pendant la Grande Guerre, des combattants occupèrent des carrières souterraines qui leur servirent d’abris et de cantonnement. Ils réalisèrent, sur les parois calcaires de ces cavités, plusieurs milliers de graffiti, de gravures et de bas-reliefs. Notre recherche entendait alors interroger cet énorme gisement de témoignages rupestres qui nous autorise à l’élever à la fois au rang de phénomène et de source directe.\n",
            "L’étude des traces rupestres a été menée en deux phases, avec d’une part leur inventaire, et d’autre part, l’exploitation du corpus ainsi constitué. Pour l’inventoriage, nous avons visité plusieurs centaines de sites se répartissant sur une aire géographique d’environ 1 000 km². Ensuite, à partir de l’inventaire des traces recensées, notre approche méthodologique, par l’intermédiaire d’une base de données, s’est fondée sur une analyse quantitative et sérielle des témoignages relevés. Lors de l’analyse de ce corpus, nous avons également confronté ces traces avec d’autres sources, notamment les témoignages écrits des combattants.\n",
            "En définitive, notre étude a été guidée par ces questions : quelle est la nature de cette source, son intérêt, son originalité mais aussi ses limites ? Contribue-t-elle à porter un regard nouveau, dans les domaines de l’histoire sociale et culturelle qui interrogent les combattants de la Grande Guerre ? Nous apporte-t-elle, dans sa spécificité, de nouveaux éclairages sur les pensées, les rêves, les fantasmes, les horizons d’attente, les revendications, les liens sociaux, les pratiques et les représentations collectives des combattants ? Et dans tous ces domaines, met-elle en lumière des différences significatives entre Français, Allemands et Américains ?\n",

            "I am an experienced acupuncturist and health professional, trained in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and 5 Element Acupuncture, integrating them both in order to obtain optimum health for my patients. In addition I also trained in Western Medical Acupuncture and have a background in conventional medicine, having qualified as a registered nurse and midwife and practiced as a healthcare professional for 30 years.\n",
            "I offer a practical and innovative approach to improving health, incorporating my knowledge and experience of both eastern and western medicine. Acupuncture is remarkably effective for a wide range of health conditions regardless of whether they are acute, chronic, physical, mental or emotional. Acupuncture is safe, effective, and beneficial for all ages, as such it is perfectly safe to use during conception when trying to get pregnant, during pregnancy, with the very young, elderly or supporting those who are or have been treated for cancer or have a chronic illness. A holistic approach ensures that each person is treated with a personalised treatment plan based on their medical history, constitution and presenting complaint.\n",

            "Acupuncture is an ancient system of healing that dates back several thousand years and is one of the oldest therapies known to man. It is a natural form of medical treatment which helps stimulate the body to respond to a condition or illness it is experiencing. This is done by inserting exceptionally fine needles into specific points around the body which stimulates the flow of energy (Qi – pronounced “Chee”). This enables a harmonious and correct flow of Qi thus aiding the healing process. Acupuncture uses as its median the meridians through which Qi, or energy flows. The meridians, like blood vessels have identical routes on both sides of the body.\n",
            "Despite common belief acupuncture is not only painless, but it is totally safe and it has been shown to succeed where at times other treatments have failed.\n",
            "It provides a natural means of alleviating pain and resolving a wide range of health problems, which is free from any harmful side effects.\n",
            "Acupuncture is frequently used and is remarkable effective in treating a wide range of conditions. In addition it is also used as a highly effective preventative measure in maintaining good health. As such people often report additional benefits beyond resolving their main complaint, such as increased energy, vitality, feeling more relaxed, less stressed and better able to deal with the challenges of modern living.\n",
            "“We have the greatest power of all,\n",
            "the ability to heal ourselves.”\n",
            "What to expect\n",
            "Acupuncture is a means of stimulating the body to respond to the condition it is experiencing. This is done by inserting exceptionally fine needles into specific points around the body. By doing this the flow of what the Chinese call ‘Qi’ or energy is stimulated, thus aiding the healing process. In western medical terms, the insertion of needles activates the release of endorphins and other chemicals in the body, helping to relieve pain, relax muscles in spasm and allowing normal and healthy blood flow.\n",
            "Acupuncture needles are extremely fine, so fine that when they’re inserted they are generally painless. However a sensation may be experienced, that is often described as a ‘tingling’, ‘dull ache’ or a ‘warm feeling’. Sterile, single use, disposable needles are used.\n",
            "The initial consultation and acupuncture treatment at the Newry practice lasts 1.5 – 2 hours, subsequent visits are up to an hour and a half, the number of sessions vary depending on the nature of the condition and how long it has been a problem. A detailed medical history is taken at the initial consultation resulting in each individual having a personalised treatment plan specific to their condition and needs.\n",
            "It is suggested to have treatments at regular intervals and as a response is achieved, the periods between treatments can be extended. Many people experience a deep sense of relaxation, along with other benefits obtained during treatment.\n",
            "Following treatment, improvements for some may be immediate, while for others it may take longer. Occasionally an aggravation of symptoms can occur, but this is short lived and is specific to certain conditions.\n",

            "The \"Impossible Switchback Railroad\" is the story of arguably the most spectacular standard gauge mountain railroad ever built in the United States. The Bradshaw Mountain Railroad was considered an \"Engineering Marvel\" when it was completed in 1904 by Frank Murphy. Murphy was Arizona Territory's leading industrialist who had been getting filthy rich over the last 20 years investing in mines and building railroads to central Arizona's most prosperous mining districts. Yet there still was a mining district that had eluded him! It was high in the 6000-foot Bradshaw Mountains protected by a place called Crazy Basin. It was thought to be impossible to build because of the prohibitive cost and the challenging mountain elevations. Locals gave it the nickname \"Bradshaw Boondoggle\" and \"Impossible Railroad\".\n",
            "Murphy was not to be deterred! He wanted a railway to where the gold, silver and copper was! He challenged his engineering teams to find a way to the summit at Crown King! Chief Engineer William Drake had a plan to conquer the mountain! Switchbacks! The result was one of the most unique mountain railroads ever built! The Bradshaw Mountain Railroad was an engineering and construction wonder when completed. The railway used 10 switchbacks, 31 wooden trestle bridges, a 142-foot tunnel and relentless track grades of up to 3.9% to climb 2,400 feet to the mountain summit.

            "\"The little domicile 'neath' the old sycamore in our today's sketch of old Santa Ana was the result of a deal between W. H.. Titchenal and W. H.. Spurgeon in 1869, the latter selling the former one lot at $15.00 and giving him another one on condition that he would build a house thereon. Thus the nucleus for a town was started. Santa Ana it was called. Other buildings followed fast.\" The above quotation and sketch of the little house appeared in the Santa Ana Daily Herald January 2, 1902. The paper published sketches of the city of Santa Ana as it looked in 1877, eight years after the town began in 1869. William H. Titchenal, my great grandfather, was the first man to purchase property and build a home in Santa Ana, California. This deal was the first tangible beginning of Santa Ana, California. That day back in 1869 not only marked the beginning of a city, it also ended more than 200 years of westward movement of the Titchenal family.\n",

            "Christmas sweaters were once as festive as a beige wall. Dull, lifeless things, they were. But then, a revolution! Designers, fueled by eggnog and a rebellious spirit, unleashed a torrent of tacky, yet undeniably enchanting sweaters upon the world. Santas with questionable abs, reindeer sporting shades, and snowmen engaging in questionable activities adorned these garments. It was a fashion rebellion, a sartorial uprising against the ordinary.\n",
            "No longer were these sweaters banished to the back of the closet, gathering dust like forgotten ornaments. They became conversation pieces, icebreakers, and, dare we say it, status symbols. From the office party to the family gathering, the ugly Christmas sweater reigned supreme. It was more than just apparel; it was a statement, a declaration of individuality, a badge of honor for those brave enough to embrace the absurd. So, ditch the boring and embrace the bizarre. Let your inner fashion rebel shine. After all, a world without ugly Christmas sweaters is a world without joy.\n",

            "There are three reasons why we proudly differentiate ourselves from the rest of the marketing agencies.\n",
            "First, we consider you a partner, not a client. We believe that the success of a marketing agency lies more in client retention than in acquiring new ones, and that if your business is doing well, so are we. This philosophy is what allows us to establish lasting relationships, and that companies feel happy to recommend us.\n",
            "Because we are interested in results, we will not burden you with \"vanity metrics\" that do not contribute to the real growth of your business, nor will we try to confuse you with hundreds of irrelevant data as so many other agencies do. We simply want what you invest in Marketing to come back multiplied in sales. In other words, we believe that Marketing is simply about making money, and we want to help you do that.\n",
            "Secondly, we are backed by our extensive experience. Our years of building relationships and hiring the best professionals make us stand out in the efficiency of our results. If you want maximum return on investment, we are your agency.\n",
            "Third, we guarantee results. When it comes to marketing, it's hard to make promises. But that doesn't stop us from making a commitment to you and telling you what we think we can get for your website. You don't have to risk an agency that doesn't want to commit to any kind of results. When you know what you are doing, you don't have to fear targets. If you want to know ambitious but realistic objectives for your business, do not hesitate to contact us.\n",

            "What is\n",
            "SEO\n",
            "and why is it important?\n",
            "SEO is the process of making your website attract more users through increased visibility in search engines. It is essential because if you are not in the top searches, your business does not exist. Therefore, the right SEO strategy will increase traffic to your site, allowing you to reach more customers and, therefore, more sales.\n",
            "What is our SEO process?\n",
            "Our SEO strategy consists of different stages. The first is research. We must know how your brand is positioned in search engines, your main competitors, and your potential customers. Our SEO specialists have professional tools to detect keyword opportunities, that is, what users look for when they search for a service like yours.\n",
            "Once these results are obtained, we proceed to build a strategy according to your needs. Within the SEO services we include, we focus on generating quality content for your brand. This will allow more users to access your page and search engines to position it better and better. We also focus on attracting inbound links to the website and generating a more significant presence on social networks.\n",
            "After these two main steps, it's time for execution. We rely on the most reliant SEO tools from recommended industry professionals coupled together with our own past experience to execute. We use safe industry techniques (known as white hat techniques) and deliver an excellent quality product.\n",

            "Are all strategies the same?\n",
            "At Digital Muscle, we carry out personalised work focused on the needs of each client. Our SEO company is constantly improving in such a competitive market to provide work in line with current trends.\n",
            "Depending on the needs of each client, we focus on different areas. Some of them are content analysis, web design, image SEO, voice SEO, youtube SEO, infographics submission, CSS submission, podcasts submission and mobile speed optimisation. We cover all the key aspects that will make your SEO campaign a success.\n",
            "Can SEO increase revenue in addition to rankings?\n",
            "Of course! Think of it this way: if you double your traffic while maintaining your conversion rate, then you will double your sales as well.\n",
            "Notice that we have said, \"while maintaining your conversion rate\". At Digital Muscle we emphasize an aspect that many seem to ignore. The keywords in which you want to position must generate conversions! It is useless to appear first in queries that will not generate sales.\n",
            "So, we will not only try to increase your traffic but also your conversion rate and therefore your sales.\n",
            "Not only do we believe that SEO can make a profit, we believe it is the best way to achieve it.\n",
            "Organic traffic is by far the largest source of traffic for almost all businesses even though (a) More than 90% of websites almost do not appear on the first page of search results, and (b), it leads longer than other marketing channels. If like us, you believe in the efficiency of the market, you know that this can only happen if it is a marketing channel with a return on investment superior to the others.\n",
            "If you still have doubts about the importance of SEO, just research the traffic sources of your main competitors, and you will be surprised. If you want to overcome them, it is not about investing more money than they do in SEO, it is about investing it better. And for that, you have us!\n",
            "A strategy that lasts over time\n",
            "Many agencies use strategies that only deliver results in the short term, and once they get paid, they disappear.\n",
            "At Digital Muscle we are constantly updated on trends, tools and changes in search engine algorithms. But above all, our results are long-lasting. You can sleep easy, because we won't do anything dodgy that will get your website penalised as soon as the search engines discover it.\n",
            "Be wary of anyone who promises great results in a very short time. We will tell you that SEO results take time, however, the good part is that it is a cumulative investment. Once your website reaches the top positions, you will earn a largely passive income.\n",
            "That's why it's crucial that your business invests a fixed and permanent budget in quality SEO. Don't leave it for later stages of your business, because the earlier you rank for certain keywords, the harder it will be for your competitors to knock you off the top spot.\n",

            "When looking for SEO companies in Australia, there are several things to consider. There are many offers out there but few have the experience and expertise to do the marketing.\n",
            "One of the most effective ways to find out if an agency offers reliable SEO services is to look at examples of previous work. Case studies will allow you to see what work was done and what was achieved.\n",
            "It is expected that you do not understand the importance or significance of some processes within an SEO campaign, so we provide you with answers to those questions:\n",
            "Frequently\n",
            "Asked\n",
            "Questions\n",
            "What is link building? Is it essential for my business?\n",
            "Link building is the process of getting relevant sites to link to yours. It allows you to reach a much wider audience and improves your page's performance in search results. In addition, having important sites link to your content is a sign of trust and authority.\n",
            ".Another reason why link building is a great online marketing tool is because of your brand's exposure. When this is achieved through trustworthy and natural techniques, search engine algorithms will detect the authority of your page and give you more visibility.\n",
            "How do you get pages related to my industry to link to my content?\n",
            "One of the strategies we use as an agency is the generation of attractive content. When you offer something of quality to users, it is almost inevitable that they will want to share it on their platforms.\n",
            "Are the pages you are trying to outreach trustworthy?\n",
            "Yes, we use industry-proven techniques to choose trustworthy pages and techniques that will not be penalised by search engines.\n",
            "Is in-house SEO or outsourcing right for my business?\n",
            "By hiring an outsourcing service, you guarantee to have the best professionals in different areas do a specific job at a specific time. It will be like having everything in one: copywriters, publicists, web developers, etc. In addition, this will allow you to save a lot of money to invest in other areas of your company.\n",
            "One of the main fears is the disconnection from the work team. They are not physically present in your company, and you cannot know how they are working. This will depend purely and exclusively on the type of company you choose. At Digital Muscle, we focus on generating a communicative bond with our clients to achieve the best goals together.\n",
            "Another benefit of outsourcing to an SEO agency is that you will benefit from the previous work. They will be an experienced team who will face the challenges that arise, taking into account the results obtained with other companies.\n",
            "Also, you are assured of knowing what you will be able to achieve with the money invested. Serious companies will provide you with examples or case studies so that you can see the results obtained, as well as a strategy with clear objectives.\n",
            "How long does SEO take?\n",
            "There is no set time. It all depends on the results obtained in the first stage: research. Stay away from those who offer you quick results without having done thorough research about your business.\n",
            "It all depends on the type of business you have. For example, a website with many links can achieve quicker results than a smaller one just starting.\n",
            "The number of your competitors will also be a factor. It is not the same to achieve a relevant ranking in an industry with few options to do so in the midst of large sites.\n",
            "In addition to the work done by specialists, some times depend solely on search engines. Many of them take weeks or months to recognise the changes made and trust your site to give you a better position.\n",
            "We can guarantee that even if it takes time, SEO is the best strategy to achieve visibility and traffic to your site.\n",
            "Are you the cheapest SEO agency?\n",
            "No, we are not. The SEO industry takes time and money. It is an investment that may be costly for many, but it guarantees a long term return on investment.\n",
            "Many companies offer services at lower costs but cannot guarantee quality work. Today many options promise great results in a short time but use dubious techniques. As soon as the search engine algorithms detect this, they penalise your website. This involves a considerable amount of money; as often, these are pages that will never achieve a good ranking again.\n",
            "At Digital Muscle, we can guarantee a customised quote depending on the scope required and the results you want to achieve. Our transparency and efficiency have made us the best SEO company in Australia.\n",
            "What to ask an SEO agency?\n",
            "When choosing the company that will carry out your SEO campaign, you can ask them for this information:\n",
            "How can you improve your ranking?\n",
            "There are no magic recipes that work for all companies at all times. So make sure they have researched your company and come up with a customised strategy that meets your needs.\n",
            "Are there case studies you can share?\n",
            "There is no better advertisement than the customers themselves. So always ask them to show you examples of previous work. This will give you a good indication of whether they can deliver.\n",
            "Are you familiar with similar projects?\n",
            "An agency with prior experience in your industry is crucial in executing the right strategy for your business. Don't believe anyone who claims that SEO works the same in every niche and always ask if they have done SEO for someone in your industry and what kind of results they got.\n",
            "How did they overcome the biggest challenges in these projects?\n",
            "Ask them how they overcame any obstacles that may have arisen. How they react to eventual setbacks, what to do if a strategy doesn't work, etc. This will help you avoid misunderstandings.\n",
            "What are the key metrics you consider when it comes to SEO?\n",
            "When hiring an SEO company, it is always good to leave guidelines in place. For example, ask them what metrics they use to evaluate the extent of the results and how you as a client will know that their work is on track.\n",
            "When is the best time to start seeing results?\n",
            "In SEO, it is practically impossible to establish exact times because there are external factors to the company, such as search engine timing. What can be defined are milestones where the agency shows you the work done so far.\n",
            "Can you guarantee that I will rank on the first page of Google?\n",
            "No. No one can provide this assurance. Google not only has hundreds of algorithms to define the order within their search engines, but they are constantly updating them. We can assure you that we will do everything in our power to get your business to the highest possible position.\n",

            "Since our humble beginnings in 2001, we’ve been working on building and improving upon the Dynamic DNS product. Starting as home users ourselves, we understand what features are important and how essential usability and availability are.\n",
            "Bigger footprint,\n",
            "better network.\n",
            "With the largest presence of all Dynamic DNS providers on home routers as well as partnerships with all of the major router producers, at-home integration is that much easier for you. Just plug in your dynamic hostname and your router already knows what to do.\n",

            "to yours.\n",
            "We aim to deliver a world-class customer experience to every customer. Our in-house support teams work in Oracle offices across the globe to deliver the best possible support at all hours of the day so we can work with your schedule—not the other way around.\n",

            "You get access to hundreds of premium domains, so you can find the domain that reflects your needs and personality!\n",
            "• Rapid propagation / low TTLs\n",
            "When your IP address changes, your hostname needs to be updated quickly. With TTLs set as low as 20 seconds, fast propagation will happen when your update client notifies us.\n",
            "• Reliable device connectivity\n",
            "• Global, in-house email support\n",
            "Dynamic DNS set-up is easy.\n",

This means setting up port forwarding on your router and enabling bridge mode on your modem. Then follow our quick setup instructions below.\n",

            "Sign-up for a Dyn.com account when you buy Dynamic DNS. If you have an account or have already purchased, simply log in.\n",
            "2. Add a new hostname\n",
            "Once you’ve logged into the interface, navigate to “DynDNS Pro” and click “Add New Hostname” to create a new web address that will be linked to your device (ex: mycomputer@dyndns.org, webcam@dyndns.org).\n",

Es ist ein traditioneller Name, der oft mit positiven Eigenschaften und Werten assoziiert wird. Touda ist für uns aber auch die talentierte Berberfrau die das alte Kunsthandwerk und kulturelle Erbe der Berber (Amazigh) in unserer modernen Welt bewahrt und sinnbildlich eine Brückenbauerin ist.\n",

I have loved the versatility and design of this leash from day one, but now just had to write another review on its durability and toughness. Never have I had a leash where the mechanism didn't get stuck from sand or ruin from the salt water... my Coast rope leash is good as new, and the leather collar, again despite daily swims an rolling in the sand (and more!), is softer and sturdier than ever.

            "I reported over the weekend an unusual video surrounding digital currencies that Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell made last week: Federal Reserve Board Chairman Powell in Unprecedented Video Issues Commentary on Digital Currencies.\n",
            "Now we have Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard following up this morning with a speech on digital currencies via webcast at the Consensus by CoinDesk 2021 Conference, Washington, D.C. that even includes reference to an MIT-Federal Reserve test of a central bank digital currency.\n",
            "This morning she told the group:\n",
            "Unlike central bank fiat currencies, stablecoins do not have legal tender status. Depending on underlying arrangements, some may expose consumers and businesses to risk. If widely adopted, stablecoins could serve as the basis of an alternative payments system oriented around new private forms of money. Given the network externalities associated with achieving scale in payments, there is a risk that the widespread use of private monies for consumer payments could fragment parts of the U.S. payment system in ways that impose burdens and raise costs for households and businesses. A predominance of private monies may introduce consumer protection and financial stability risks because of their potential volatility and the risk of run-like behavior. Indeed, the period in the nineteenth century when there was active competition among issuers of private paper banknotes in the United States is now notorious for inefficiency, fraud, and instability in the payments system.4 It led to the need for a uniform form of money backed by the national government.\n",

            "The Federal Reserve remains committed to ensuring that the public has access to safe, reliable, and secure means of payment, including cash. As part of this commitment, we must explore—and try to anticipate—the extent to which households' and businesses' needs and preferences may migrate further to digital payments over time.\n",
            "---\n",
            "Given the potential for CBDCs to gain prominence in cross-border payments and the reserve currency role of the dollar, it is vital for the United States to be at the table in the development of cross-border standards.\n",
            "---\n",
            "[A] digital dollar would be a new type of central bank money issued in digital form for use by the general public. By introducing safe central bank money that is accessible to households and businesses in digital payments systems, a CBDC would reduce counterparty risk and the associated consumer protection and financial stability risks...One expected benefit is that a CBDC would reduce or even eliminate operational and financial inefficiencies, or other frictions, in payments, clearing, and settlement.\n",
            "---\n",
            "Increase financial inclusion\n",
            "Today 5.4 percent of American households lack access to bank accounts and the associated payment options they offer, and a further 18.7 percent were underbanked as of 2017...CBDC may be one part of a broader solution to the challenge of achieving ubiquitous account access.\n",

Virginia Woolf noted that on occasion Keynes served a miserly three grouse to his eleven guests - the visitors’ “eyes gleaned as the bones went round,” she later remarked with the regulation Bloomsbury barb.\n",

            "Deafness is defined as hearing loss, which relates directly to the volume of sound that a person is capable of perceiving. This also pertains to the frequency of sound a person may or may not hear. While some people have specific difficulties in hearing low- or high-pitched sounds, some people cannot hear anything at all. A loss of hearing is related to the condition of the inner ear and whether there was a problem from birth or the hearing loss occurred much later.\n",
            "Deaf Culture & Sign Language\n",
            "People in the deaf community have enjoyed the Internet and computers because it has opened up a whole new deaf world for them. Many deaf sites exist for those with a hearing loss and that includes a means for deaf people to receive deaf world news, review deaf events in Maryland, deaf events NYC or deaf events Bay Area, connect with deaf groups, create a deaf directory, find deaf resources, find a deaf chat online website, a deaf website and so much more.\n",

For the deaf person, he or she may be more comfortable dating deaf people or finding a deaf club, a deaf event or even deaf chat rooms where a person can mingle and feel comfortable among people who understand. For the deaf person, when he or she is in an online deaf chat room, visiting one of the many deaf websites, or involved in deaf chat, there is no difference between the deaf person and anyone else online.\n",
            "Making the deaf connection starts with communication and learning sign language. To speak with a deaf person, it’s important to face them and enunciate clearly for those who can lip read. While rudimentary sign language is a form of communication, most deaf people learn the American Sign Language that consists of a series of gestures for commonly used terms and an alphabet to spell out words that aren’t commonly used.\n",

Sign language is quick and easy to learn, if you take the time to do so. There are many deaf culture websites and deaf websites that show you the basics of sign language, if you would like to learn this language. Several schools have also classified sign language as a foreign language so that those who take it receive school credit.\n",

            "Deaf culture refers to the social beliefs, behaviors, art, literary traditions, history, values, and shared institutions of communities that are influenced by deafness and which use sign languages as the main means of communication. It’s important to understand that being deaf is not just a physical condition but also encompasses a rich cultural identity. Members of the Deaf community typically view their hearing loss not as a disability, but as a unique characteristic that provides them a distinct perspective. This culture is centered around the use of sign language and values such as inclusivity, resilience, and the celebration of achievements within the deaf community. The community also fosters a strong sense of solidarity and pride, often represented through social events, organizations, and gatherings where sign language and deaf culture are celebrated. It’s also marked by a distinct set of social norms, traditions, and artistic expressions that are unique to the Deaf community.\n",

            "What are the Common Causes of Hearing Loss?\n",
            "Hearing loss can be attributed to a variety of factors, ranging from genetic predispositions to environmental influences. One of the most prevalent causes is prolonged exposure to loud noises, which can damage the sensitive structures in the inner ear. This type of hearing loss, known as noise-induced hearing loss, can result from a one-time exposure to an intense sound or from repeated exposure to loud sounds over time.\n",
            "Aging is another significant cause, known as presbycusis. As we age, changes in the inner ear gradually reduce our ability to hear. This process can be exacerbated by other factors like smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes.\n",
            "Other causes include infections, such as otitis media, head injuries, certain medications that are toxic to the auditory system (ototoxic), and genetic factors where hearing loss is inherited. In some cases, hearing loss can be a result of blockages in the ear, such as earwax buildup, which can prevent sound waves from reaching the inner ear effectively.\n",

            "What is sign language and how does it differ from spoken languages?\n",
            "Sign language is a comprehensive, natural language that uses manual communication and body language to convey meaning. It’s not a mere collection of gestures but a fully-fledged language with its own grammar, syntax, and nuances, much like any spoken language. Unlike spoken languages, which rely on vocalization and auditory reception, sign languages are visual-gestural. This means they are perceived through sight and expressed through handshapes, movements, facial expressions, and body postures. Each country or region often has its own sign language, with unique linguistic structures. For example, American Sign Language (ASL) is different from British Sign Language (BSL), reflecting the diversity in sign languages akin to spoken languages.\n",

            "What is Deaf Education?\n",
            "Deaf Education refers to the educational practices designed specifically for students who are deaf or hard of hearing. This field encompasses a wide range of teaching strategies, tools, and resources that aim to provide an accessible and effective learning environment for these students.\n",
            "Deaf Education recognizes the unique needs of deaf students, including language development, social and emotional needs, and the development of cognitive skills. It often involves the use of sign language, assistive technology, and visual teaching methods. In addition to academic learning, Deaf Education also focuses on helping students develop life skills, self-advocacy, and a strong sense of identity within the deaf community.\n",
            "Educators in this field are typically trained in specific methodologies and are skilled in various communication modes such as American Sign Language (ASL), Signed Exact English (SEE), or other forms of manual or visual communication. The goal of Deaf Education is not just to impart standard academic knowledge but also to foster a learning environment where deaf students can thrive both intellectually and socially.\n",

            "How early can deafness be detected in children, and what are the signs?\n",
            "Deafness in children can often be detected very early, sometimes as soon as a few days after birth. Newborn hearing screenings are standard in many hospitals, helping to identify hearing loss from the start. If this initial screening is missed, parents and caregivers can look out for signs as the child grows. These include a lack of response to loud noises, absence of babbling by the age of 6 months, and not reacting to their name by the age of 1 year. Other indicators may include the child not being startled by sudden loud noises, or not turning their head in the direction of sounds. It’s important to remember that every child is different, and these milestones can vary. If there are concerns about a child’s hearing, it’s crucial to consult a healthcare professional who can conduct more comprehensive hearing tests. Early detection is key to addressing any challenges and facilitating effective communication development.\n",

            "What are hearing aids, and how do they work?\n",
            "Hearing aids are electronic devices designed to amplify sound and improve hearing for individuals with hearing loss. They work by capturing sounds from the environment through a microphone, processing these sounds using advanced technology, and then delivering them to the wearer’s ears through a speaker. The amplification process is customized to the wearer’s specific hearing needs, making it easier for them to hear and understand speech and other sounds.\n",
            "Modern  hearing aids are equipped with sophisticated features like noise reduction, directional microphones, and wireless connectivity to enhance the listening experience. They come in various styles, from behind-the-ear (BTE) to in-the-ear (ITE), allowing users to choose the one that best suits their preferences and degree of hearing loss.\n",
            "Hearing aids are a valuable tool for improving communication, social interactions, and overall quality of life for individuals with hearing impairments. They are typically prescribed and fitted by audiologists or hearing care professionals to ensure optimal performance and comfort.\n",

The principal focus of this research is to understand representations and algorithms to enable the efficiency and generality of learning for interaction in autonomous agents. We work on challenging open problems at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. We develop algorithms and systems that unify reinforcement learning, control theoretic modeling, causality, and 2D/3D visual scene understanding to teach robots to perceive and to interact with the physical world.

            "Bigger footprint,\n",
            "better network.\n",
            "With the largest presence of all Dynamic DNS providers on home routers as well as partnerships with all of the major router producers, at-home integration is that much easier for you. Just plug in your dynamic hostname and your router already knows what to do.\n",
            "From our house\n",
            "to yours.\n",
            "We aim to deliver a world-class customer experience to every customer. Our in-house support teams work in Oracle offices across the globe to deliver the best possible support at all hours of the day so we can work with your schedule—not the other way around.\n",

            "• Hundreds of premium domains\n",
            "You get access to hundreds of premium domains, so you can find the domain that reflects your needs and personality!\n",
            "• Rapid propagation / low TTLs\n",
            "When your IP address changes, your hostname needs to be updated quickly. With TTLs set as low as 20 seconds, fast propagation will happen when your update client notifies us.\n",
            "• Reliable device connectivity\n",
            "• Global, in-house email support\n",
            "Dynamic DNS set-up is easy.\n",
            "Setting up Dynamic DNS can be done in just a few steps, with no hassle and no wait. Just connect the device to your home router and allow external traffic for your router and modem. This means setting up port forwarding on your router and enabling bridge mode on your modem. Then follow our quick setup instructions below.\n",
            "1. Sign Up\n",
            "Sign-up for a Dyn.com account when you buy Dynamic DNS. If you have an account or have already purchased, simply log in.\n",
            "2. Add a new hostname\n",
            "Once you’ve logged into the interface, navigate to “DynDNS Pro” and click “Add New Hostname” to create a new web address that will be linked to your device (ex: mycomputer@dyndns.org, webcam@dyndns.org).\n",
            "3. Test your hostname\n",
            "Test the hostname you created by typing it into a web browser bar outside your home network. If it loads, then you are connected properly.\n",
            "4. Install the updater\n",
            "Lastly, install the Dyn updater client. Some devices may already have Dyn’s updater client pre-installed; for these, simply navigate to the application’s DynDNS section for set-up.\n",

В начале компания предоставляла исключительно букмекерские услуги, но позже добавила разделы казино и покер-рум. Мостбет работает по лицензии Кюрасао, что подтверждается на официальном сайте. Чтобы проверить лицензию, просто войдите на официальный сайт Мостбет и прокрутите страницу до футера, где найдете кликабельную икону. Кликнув по ней, вы попадете на верификатор, который подтвердит разрешение на ведение игорного бизнеса онлайн. Однако стоит отметить, что этот метод не работает на рабочих зеркалах Мостбет сегодня.\n",
